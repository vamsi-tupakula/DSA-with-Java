# Arrays Important Points ✨✨

## How does array works?
Declaration => `int arr[]` => array is being defined in the stack
Initialization => `arr = new int[5]` => object is being created in the memory (Heap)

Declaration happens at compile time and Initilaization happens at runtime.

Initializing the array using `new` keyword is known as dynamic memory allocation.

```
When an array is passed into a function as an argument and if the function makes changes to that argument then the changes are also gonna reflect in the original array.
