# Basic Java Notes

## When was java created?
Java was created by James Gosling. Sun Microsystems officially launched java in the year 1995. (Now sun is a part of Oracle .Inc)

## How does Java Code Run?
There are two steps in executing a java program
1. Compilation
2. Execution

In compilation step, our source code which we wrote will be converted into a byte code by the JDK. In execution step, byte code is converted into Machine understandable code (Native code) by JVM (java vitual machine).

## What is difference between bytecode and native code?
Native code is also known as the machine code, as the name suggest the code is readable by machine. Bytecode is like the intermediate code between Source code and machine code. Bytecode is executed by Virtual machine and then by the CPU, but machine code is not executed by virtual machine, it is directly executed by CPU.
