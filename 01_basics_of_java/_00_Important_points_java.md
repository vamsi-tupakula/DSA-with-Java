# Basic Java Notes

## When was java created?
Java was created by James Gosling. Sun Microsystems officially launched java in the year 1995. (Now sun is a part of Oracle .Inc)

## How does Java Code Run?
There are two steps in executing a java program
1. Compilation
2. Execution

In compilation step, our source code which we wrote will be converted into a byte code by the JDK. In execution step, byte code is converted into Machine understandable code (Native code) by JVM (java vitual machine).

## What is difference between bytecode and native code?
Native code is also known as the machine code, as the name suggest the code is readable by machine. Bytecode is like the intermediate code between Source code and machine code. Bytecode is executed by Virtual machine and then by the CPU, but machine code is not executed by virtual machine, it is directly executed by CPU.

## What are Variables?
Variables are the user-defined memory locations which can be used to store data. Updating of variables can be possible at any level.
Java is a typed language which means the type of variable is predefined before the name of the variable, but Languages like javascript is not a typed language.

## What are types of data types in Java?
There are two types of data types one is primitive and another is non-primitive.
Byte, short, char, int, float, double, long, boolean are known as primitive data types and String, Array, Class, Object, Interface are non-primitive data types. non-primitive data types are formed by combining primitive data types.

## What are Identifiers?
Identifiers are user defined names to functions or classes or interfaces or variables.

## what is the difference between identifiers and variables?
All Variables are identifiers but all identifiers are not variables.

## what is literal?
If we consider a variable a which is defined as `int a = 15` then a is known as identifier and 15 is known as the literal.
